# Mapping_Earthquakes
A Javascript/D3/Leaflet.js data visualizaion project to create an easy-to-use, interactive world map by traversing and retrieving GeoJSON earthquake and tectonic plate data and plotting the map with Mapbox API. Earthquake location and magnitude are shown in a pop-up marker where the diameter of each relfects the magnitude in its size and color. Fault lines are added to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
Tasks

To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Approach

Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.
