# Mapping_Earthquakes
A Javascript/D3/Leaflet.js data visualizaion project to create an easy-to-use, interactive world map by traversing and retrieving GeoJSON earthquake and tectonic plate data and plotting the map with Mapbox API. Earthquake location and magnitude are shown in a pop-up marker where the diameter of each relfects the magnitude in its size and color. Fault lines are added to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.
